# SHOPPPIT

## About
Shopppit (with three Ps) is the 4th and final project as a WDI student at General Assembly.   This app pays homage to a vice that surfaces whenever I'm stressed (which happened a lot throughout my time at WDI!) - online shopping aka shopping with monopoly money.  I wanted to walk myself through the steps of actually building an ecommerce website from the user's perspective, as well as the admin/business owner's perspective.
