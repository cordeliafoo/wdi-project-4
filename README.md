# SHOPPPIT

## About
Shopppit (with three Ps) is my 4th and final project as a Web Development Immersive student at General Assembly.   This app pays homage to a vice that surfaces whenever I'm stressed (which happened a lot throughout my time at WDI!) - online shopping aka shopping with monopoly money.  I wanted to walk myself through the steps of actually building an ecommerce website from the user's perspective, as well as from the admin/business owner's perspective. 

This full-stack app is built with node js, Express, MongoLab with Bootstrap as the frontend framework.
